# Juice - Mixins for Life

Simplify your life. Juice is a collection of SASS mixins/functions/placeholders that are used to minimize the work needed to apply styling/properties to elements. Juice is not just a collection to help with cross browser support, so it is best paired with autoprefixer, for the best possible browser compatability.

## Installation

You can use either bower or just clone the github repo directly.

#### Bower

$ bower install juice
```

#### Clone/Fork

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:kjbrum/juice.git
```

## Using the file

Just import the "_juice.scss" file into your main scss file: 
```bash
@import "juice";
```

## To-do:

+ Cut down on the code for triangle mixin (Use sass maps for "trbl" and translate direction, maybe direction and border direction also) (add in the option to make a border and triangle shape)
+ Turn placeholders into argument-less mixins?
