#### Features:# Juice - Mixins for Life

Simplify your life. Juice is a collection of SASS mixins/functions/placeholders that is used to minimize the work needed to apply  styling/properties to element. Juice is not just a collection to help with cross browser support, so it is best paired with autoprefixer, for the best possible browser compatability.
